            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He well-grounded cauſes of our eagle-eyed Aſſemblies of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, the two carefull watch-houſes of this ſlubbered common-wealth, have dropt down effects, preventing the haſty wiſhes of Militia-minded Denizons; with ſuch iſſues thoſe happy Twins court our Kingdome; which hath ſo long lien bedabled in ſinks of miſery. Thus ſucceſſefully have thoſe choice Engineers countermined the vain-drawn plots of leering cavilling Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſts.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:197479:3"/>Thoſe top-Gallants have already read their Croſſe Row, and have given their ſquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring thoughts warning to liſt themſelves in a narrower circuit: <hi>York</hi> fathered their deſignes at their birth, but caſt them off before they came to age; els might they have butchered their moher: they have ſowed for lives, but reaped loſſe: <hi>Hull</hi> makes their words with ſorrow to rebound on their hearts, and hath wrote ſuch letters on their bodies as they ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with their blood. Now would they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it, but the very weak water freezado'd on them, and would have purified their infected pitchy carkaſſes, had not they wing'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with flight. Now would they have ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized the town by night; but being belighted by the day-ſpring of detection, they bought their enterprize at a bodily rate. Somtimes was the Lord <hi>Brook</hi> a rub in their way and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their bias, delivering them up to their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditour, earth. The <hi>Militia</hi> every where either ſtrangleth their proceedings in the wombe, or ſowſeth them with let-in terrours of theſe bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie ſenſes, Sight and Feeling. Still hath our bleſſed Parliaments actions ingraved ſo firm a ſtamp of loyalty in the Citizens breſts, that they have been crowned with ſucceſſe: and we may ſuck the pure aire of comfort, in that each Citizens face portends a miſchief to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers, whoſe hearts, as new-rais'd bulwarks, not onely eiaculate magnanimous words, but
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:197479:3"/>are ready to vivifie action. So unanimouſly each beats a march in his thoughts, as ready to ſtifle the doubtfull acts of our rich-fac'd enemies, whoſe heads periwig'd with malicious pride, ſtrive to dead our new-born enterprizes. Each day and night their active hands itch to be fencing in a reall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, whoſe quotidian exerciſe do plainly depaint what the adverſary may expect, and not be fruſtrate of: Their purſe is as free as their heart, which they moſt willingly part with.</p>
            <p>The Earle of <hi>Eſſex</hi> that renowned peece of chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry, as vertuous as honourable, vowing glory but a by-word, and his Coat worthy of nought but to be diſheraulded, if this Iſland, with the fame of it, being almoſt out of breath, be not re-involved with Royalty, to yeeld him a double creſt of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded dignity. Wherefore as voluntary as his war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſucceeding champions, he budded forth of this city, impoveriſhing it, by the luſtre of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. And now having given a full reſponſe to the Parliaments deſires, he hath vented his, which are as followes. 1. That the hopefull Parliament would not ſuffer their thoughts concerning him or his affaires to be adulterated with ſuſpicious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits and ſide-interpretation: ſuch comments be far from being tabled on his vertuous texts. 2. That they would not bear a ſtrjct hand in reviving his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; but that coin may in due time be levied, for it is a ſouldiers beſt lining. 3. That they would fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the ſeas with ſhipping, that the adverſary might not gain an overcoming invective power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Hull</hi> or adiacent places.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:197479:4"/>
            <p> And laſtly, that they would make up the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of his army, as neceſsity gives the word of command, when he ſhall urge it, not yet ſtart from their reſolution, whereon both their ſafety dwels. Theſe were ſubiects of his indirement: who not only approves, but is approved of for his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Affections chained as well to his perſon as actions, prove the ſequell of the major: And thouſands attracted by the loadſtone of either, would rather draw cuts in, then for his ſociety; our ſpiritfull apprentices forſook their miſtris <hi>Venus,</hi> and would now traffique with <hi>Mars.</hi> What do ye lack, which before percht upon their tongues, is cloath'd with an <hi>Ad Arma, Ad Arma;</hi> preciſe purity is converted into martiall policy, the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of ſhop to ſhoot, of wares to wars: every one now would rather ſee an enemie then a cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Me thought I was all ayre when I eyed obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and alacrity well mer. There might ye ſee a rank of Diers, who would fain learn to die their ſwords in bloud, &amp; themſelves rather in the duskie bands of <hi>Mars,</hi> then in a rigrid work-houſe: theſe were in number 71. Then a troup of Butchers, who would rather ſacrifice men then beaſts for the paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of our bruiſed State: theſe amounted to 88. Here were weavers contracted, who, maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the compariſon of mans life to a ſhuttle, will make it good upon the adverſary: and as iourney-men to the fatall ſiſters, will help to weave out the ſhort thred of their troubleſome lives: and theſe were upon the ſcore 186. A knot of taylors to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:197479:4"/>ſtitch up the army were congeſted, threatning to cut out ſeveral ſuits for death, the liſt of theſe is 157. Shoomakers amongſt the reſt vampt in, vowing to to underlay them in the earth, theſe made up the number of one hundred twenty foure. Brokers hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in amongſt them and determined to make a new Long-lane with the enemies garments, whoſe Account is foureſcore and eight. Sadlers thronged in amongſt them, ſwearing they would make them place the ſaddle of government on the right horſe, and theſe ſtreacht to Forty nine; Smiths would hammer them, Cutlers ſlaſh them, and a promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous Number of many trades (prefering their Countryes ſervice before their Maſters) proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ruine. Indeed I am taken up by fawning wonder that their virtue ſhines no brighter in ſo darke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a miſt, ſince oppoſition hath ſpoke them glorious; but ſince audacity buried in the aſhes may be rackt up, and inflamed by a ſilver Speech, I ſhall diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver an Oration voic'd to them by Captain <hi>Llhoyd.</hi>
